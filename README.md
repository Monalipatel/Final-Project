# Final-Project
The objective of this project is to understand house price data through visualization. We first used Jupyter Notebook with Python and Pandas to clean and prepare the data set for machine learning. This first step also allows us to get a better understanding of the data which is helpful when we applied our machine learning code. Machine learning is used to predict house prices given the data set we used. We also developed an application that will predict a house's price given user inputs. This app was hosted on Hroku.
